# Rides Coordinator Bot

This is a Discord bot that puts out an announcement for users who need a ride for some event. Users who react to the message will automatically be paired with a driver. The pairings use network graph flow algorithms and takes into number of cars, deviation from standard route without pickups, and where groups of people need to be picked up.

Commands:
```
!send - sends ride message
!get_reactions - lists users who have reacted
```
