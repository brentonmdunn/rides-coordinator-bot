        # We use grep to search for 'print(' recursively (-r) inside the 'app/' directory.
        # We only include files ending in .py (--include=\*.py).
        # The command is structured to provide clear success or failure messages.
        #
        # How it works:
        # 1. `grep ...`: Searches for the pattern. It exits with 0 (success) if found, and 1 (failure) if not found.
        # 2. `&& (...)`: This part only runs if grep SUCCEEDS (finds a print statement). It prints an error and exits with 1, failing the step.
        # 3. `|| echo ...`: This part only runs if grep FAILS (finds no print statements). It prints a success message, and the step succeeds.
